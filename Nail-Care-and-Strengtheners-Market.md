The industry saw increased sales across key segments, including nail polishes, strengtheners, cuticle treatments, and nail health supplements.</p><ul> <li><strong>Consumer Shifts:</strong> A key factor in this growth was the increasing number of consumers seeking at-home nail care solutions. As DIY beauty became more popular, the demand for effective, professional-grade products soared.</li> <li><strong>Product Innovation:</strong> Brands invested heavily in product development, offering solutions that catered to specific nail concerns, such as brittle nails, nail fungus, and cuticle dryness.
